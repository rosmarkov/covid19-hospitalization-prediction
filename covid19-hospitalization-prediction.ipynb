        "\n",
        "This notebook demonstrates an end-to-end pipeline to predict whether a COVID-19 infection will lead to hospitalization. We use publicly available clinical notes data from Synthea Covid19 100K dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Analysis steps\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Create narratives combining comorbidities, encounters, and medications for ~180K records.\n",
        "2. Generate embeddings with sentence-transformers and trained a logistic regression (LogReg) model\n",
        "3. Use Chain-of-Thought (CoT) to interpret predictions step by step. \n",
        "4. Run GPT-4o and o3-mini in zero-shot and few-shot modes on a test batch of 100 patients.\n",
        "5. Compare performance (GPT vs. LogReg) using standard metrics\n",
        "\n",
        "## Findings\n",
        "\n",
        "* LLMs are not plug-and-play classifiers; they need careful prompt tuning.\n",
        "* Few-shot prompting helps, but is sensitive to the balance and clarity of examples. \n",
        "* Model selection in combination with the right few-shot prompting strategy comes close to LogReg performance.\n",
        "* Traditional models perform extremely well for binary prediction when features are well engineered.\n",
        "* LLM evaluation needs more than accuracy: sensitivity to rare cases and repeatability."

Comorbidities include: Acute bronchitis (disorder), Hypertension, Chronic sinusitis (disorder). Encounter types: wellness (6), ambulatory (3), emergency (1), outpatient (1). Medications prescribed: Hydrochlorothiazide 25 MG Oral Tablet, Acetaminophen 325 MG Oral Tablet.\n",

            "Explanation:\n",
            " Step 1: Patient Profile and Age\n",
            "• The patient is around 50 years old, which, although not young, is not at the highest risk category (like much older adults) for severe COVID-19 complications.\n",
            "\n",
            "Step 2: Comorbidities and Their Impact\n",
            "• The noted comorbidities include acute bronchitis, hypertension, and chronic sinusitis.\n",
            "• While hypertension is a known risk factor for more severe COVID-19, the patient’s other conditions are not strongly associated with a rapid progression to severe disease.\n",
            "• There was no mention of other high-risk conditions (like severe chronic lung disease, heart failure, or immunosuppression) that would typically increase the need for hospitalization.\n",
            "\n",
            "Step 3: Encounter Patterns\n",
            "• The patient has had several wellness and ambulatory encounters (6 wellness and 3 ambulatory visits) but only one emergency and one outpatient encounter.\n",
            "• This pattern suggests regular routine care and monitoring rather than frequent urgent or inpatient care, implying his condition was managed effectively in an outpatient setting.\n",
            "• The low frequency of emergency care encounters implies that his symptoms did not lead to severe exacerbations requiring hospitalization.\n",
            "\n",
            "Step 4: Medications Prescribed\n",
            "• The medications include Hydrochlorothiazide (for hypertension) and Acetaminophen (likely for fever or pain management).\n",
            "• There are no medications that would indicate an aggressive treatment regimen for severe COVID-19, such as high-flow oxygen or antiviral therapies usually seen in inpatient settings.\n",
            "\n",
            "Step 5: COVID-19 Diagnosis and Management Context\n",
            "• The diagnosis of COVID-19 on 2020-03-07, during early pandemic stages, was often managed on an outpatient basis for patients not exhibiting severe symptoms.\n",
            "• In the absence of indicators of hypoxia or respiratory distress (based on available clinical data), the patient would have been advised to isolate and manage mild symptoms at home.\n",
            "\n",
            "Conclusion:\n",
            "The patient was likely not hospitalized because his overall clinical picture—managed comorbidities, predominantly routine and ambulatory care visits, mild symptom management with basic medications, and no evidence of severe respiratory distress—suggested that his COVID-19 infection did not progress to a severity requiring hospital admission.\n"
